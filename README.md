## Inspiration
The concept for ReelReview was inspired by the existing limitations in e-commerce review systems. We aimed to enhance the e-commerce experience by allowing users to interact with products through video reviews, offering a more engaging and comprehensive way to shop online.

## What ReelReview Does
ReelReview integrates directly with TikTok Shop, enabling users to post TikTok videos as reviews. This feature allows for a more immersive and authentic view of products, encouraging user engagement and providing potential buyers with valuable insights into product use and quality.

## How We Built It
Our team developed ReelReview during a hackathon, utilizing React Native and TypeScript for a performant mobile app experience. Firebase served as the backbone for our authentication, database, and hosting needs.

> **Note**: The Firebase key included in this project has expired. You will need to set up your own Firebase project and use your keys to fully test this app.

## Challenges
Our journey was met with challenges, including ensuring seamless integration with TikTok Shop's existing platform and creating an intuitive user interface that encourages active participation and content creation.

## Accomplishments
We take pride in successfully crafting ReelReview, a feature that elevates the shopping experience on TikTok Shop by providing a space for authentic and engaging product reviews, fostering a community-centric platform for e-commerce.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure authentication process for user login and signup.
- **TikTok Integration**: Easy linking of TikTok videos to products as part of the review process.
- **Incentive Program**: A rewards system that incentivizes users to produce high-quality and helpful review content.

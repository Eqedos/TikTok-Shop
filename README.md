## Installation

Before you can use the ReelReview app, you need to set it up on your local machine. Follow these steps to get started:

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

1. **Node.js**: You can download and install it from [the official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Expo CLI**: Install Expo CLI globally using npm by running the following command in your terminal:

'''npm install -g expo-cli'''


### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the ReelReview app repository to your local machine using Git:

'''git clone https://github.com/Eqedos/TikTok-Shop.git'''


2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your working directory to the ReelReview project folder:

'''cd TikTok-Shop'''


3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the project dependencies by running:

'''npm i'''


4. **Set Up Firebase**: Create a Firebase project and set up authentication and Firestore for your project. Replace the Firebase configuration in the code with your own Firebase configuration. You can find the Firebase setup instructions on the [Firebase website](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).

5. **Start the Development Server**: Start the Expo development server by running:

'''expo start'''


6. **Scan QR Code**: A browser window will open, and you will see a QR code. Use the Expo Go app on your mobile device to scan the QR code, and it will open the app on your device.

### Usage

You should now have the ReelReview app up and running on your mobile device. You can explore its features, including user authentication, TikTok integration, and more.

Please note that this guide assumes you have some familiarity with setting up and using Expo projects.

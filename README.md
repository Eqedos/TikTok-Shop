## Inspiration
The concept for ReelReview was inspired by the existing limitations in e-commerce review systems. We aimed to enhance the e-commerce experience by allowing users to interact with products through video reviews, offering a more engaging and comprehensive way to shop online.

## What ReelReview Does
ReelReview integrates directly with TikTok Shop, enabling users to post TikTok videos as reviews. This feature allows for a more immersive and authentic view of products, encouraging user engagement and providing potential buyers with valuable insights into product use and quality.

## How We Built It
Our team developed ReelReview during a hackathon, utilizing React Native and TypeScript for a performant mobile app experience. Firebase served as the backbone for our authentication, database, and hosting needs.
